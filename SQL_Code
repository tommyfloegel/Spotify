# After uploading my personal data to BigQuery, first step is to clean the data. I want to create a new table with distinct artist names, total msPlayed, 
and excluding Artists containing "Podcast"

SELECT artistName, 
SUM(msPlayed) AS Total_msPlayed
FROM `calm-sylph-396720.spotify.spotify_listening` 
WHERE artistName NOT LIKE "%Podcast%"
GROUP BY artistName

# Exported table as 'spotify_listening_totals"

ALTER TABLE `spotify.spotify_listening_totals` 
ADD COLUMN Seconds_Played 

## Added Column Seconds_Played

UPDATE `spotify.spotify_listening_totals`
SET Seconds_Played = Total_msPlayed/1000
WHERE Total_msPlayed > 0

# Ordered the table by most listens

SELECT *
FROM`spotify.spotify_listening_totals`
WHERE Total_msPlayed > 0
ORDER BY Seconds_Played DESC

## I saw one podcast slipped through the cracks, so going to remove that entry

SELECT *
FROM`spotify.spotify_listening_totals`
WHERE Total_msPlayed > 0
AND artistName != "This Past Weekend"
ORDER BY Seconds_Played DESC

## Upon further inspection, I decided I'd rather work with minutes so added a final "Minutes_Played" column

ALTER TABLE `calm-sylph-396720.spotify.spotify_listening_totals` 
ADD COLUMN Minutes_Played FLOAT64

## Added data in the new column

UPDATE `spotify.spotify_listening_totals`
SET Minutes_Played = Seconds_Played/60
WHERE Total_msPlayed > 0

## The new column had long decimal tails, so I rounded those to two places
### I also will limit to the top 25 artists

SELECT artistName,
ROUND(Minutes_Played,2)
FROM `spotify.spotify_listening_totals`
WHERE Total_msPlayed > 0
AND artistName != "This Past Weekend"
ORDER BY Seconds_Played DESC
LIMIT 25

# Export as 'Top_25' and begin the Genre Mathching process. Add genres in. Tedious process as this must be done manually, but will provide better insights into listening trends
## To simplify the process, I exported the Top_25 table to a spreadsheet to fill in the genres. This could also be done with INSERT functions in SQL,
but for time purposes I will create an ArtistName/Genre Table to join the Top_25 Table. 
### Created table Genre with data stated above, and joined the tables for my Final Table

SELECT 
  artistName,
  Minutes_Played,
  Genre
FROM `spotify.Top_25`
JOIN `spotify.Genre`
ON (
artistName = Artist_Name
)

# Export final Table with Artist Name, Minutes Played, and Genre for visualization!
